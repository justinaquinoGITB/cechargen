# cepheus_engine_character_generator
This JavaScript character generator for the Cepheus Engine sci-fi roleplaying game follows the character creation rules found here [available in PDF](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/186894/Cepheus-Engine-System-Reference-Document ).
This is based on https://github.com/pgorman/travellercharactergenerator classic Traveller character generator, I copied the files into this unlinked project so that I dont accidentally break his work. I'm learning to use Gitub through trial and error, and no formal training so expect me to make a lot of mistakes. 
~~Yes, characters _can_ die during character creation!~~

How to Test (See notes 231102_00; additional changes 231103; testing pushing local changes to remote 231103)
1. Check out the effect of Changes in [https://justinaquinogitb.github.io/cepheus_engine_character_generator/index.html?history=verbose](https://justinaquinogitb.github.io/cepheus_engine_character_generator/index.html?history=verbose)
2. More importantly if you want to create the same project you can create a new repository, download and manually copy the files into that new repository (I did this because this allows me to instantly make changes without worrying about affecting pgorman's project).
3.
